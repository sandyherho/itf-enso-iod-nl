KEY FINDINGS
------------------------------------------------------------

1. ITF SEASONAL VARIABILITY:
   • ITF transport shows clear annual cycle
   • Strongest flow typically in austral winter (JJA)
   • Weakest flow in austral summer (DJF)
   • All components (G, T, S) show significant seasonality

2. ENSO SEASONALITY:
   • ENSO shows seasonal phase-locking
   • Tends to peak during boreal winter
   • Development typically begins in boreal spring/summer

3. IOD SEASONALITY:
   • IOD has strong seasonal cycle
   • Peak phase during SON (Sep-Oct-Nov)
   • Decay during DJF with monsoon onset

4. CLIMATE-ITF RELATIONSHIPS:
   • Annual cycles show varying degrees of correlation
   • Phase relationships suggest potential predictability
   • Statistical significance confirms robust seasonal patterns
